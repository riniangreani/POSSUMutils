The tests use the database connection details used in test.env file. Please create the test.env file with the following keys:

DATABASE_HOST=
DATABASE_PORT=
DATABASE_NAME=
DATABASE_USER=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=

!!IMPORTANT: Please DO NOT use production database for tests, as it will be emptied afterwards!!

You need to provide an empty database for the tests to run. It is easy to do this with psql. 
The tests will create possum schema if it's not already there, and it will be dropped with the contents afterwards.
So you need to make sure this database is not going to be used elsewhere.

How to run the tests:
=====================
In the root directory (POSSUMutils), to run individual test: 

python3 -m unittest <automation.unit_tests.test-file-name>

OR, to run all tests:
 
python -m unittest discover
