"""
Functions to run CANFAR sessions with polling and retries.
This is needed because sometimes Prefect does not know that CANFAR session has been terminated or
failed and the job would need to be manually rerun.
In this module, we try to rerun the job upon failure, up to set amount of retries.
If we've reached maximum retries and the job still fails, raise an exception to trigger a Prefect failure.
